## 8 Powerful Lessons From The Book "Can't Hurt Me"

1. Don't just get motivated. Get obsessed.  Motivation fades, but obsession pulls you through difficult odds.
2. Be your own hero, and be uncommon in your own world.  You can be "uncommon" in being a parent, a teacher, or someone working in a company.
3. Callous your Mind by Making Uncomfortable Choices.  Chase pain in one domain, and learn to see through it, to be able to conquer pain elsewhere in life.
4. Earn your place every day.   Never get complacent. You always have something to prove â€” to yourself.
5. Embrace being "The Other". Being uncommon means being different. Which can only mean good!
6. Conquer other people's minds (and "take their souls").  Leapfrog others' expectations of you, shocking them, so they are at a loss how to dominate you.
7. Run your own race, and don't let others dictate your reality.   You're only competing against yourself.
8. Think about others, and lead from the front.  Help others, and your own burden will become much lighter.
